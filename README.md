Disclaimer: This schema is currently broken, if you wish to contribute to fixing it up for others to use out of the box then submit pull requests and we will review them. 

We started this project a while ago with good intentions, Cat has been the main coder behind the schema and he deserves most if not all of the credit for this code, we used systems from Lazarus' 1.0 schema (with their blessings). We hope you make good use of the schema with what is there.
